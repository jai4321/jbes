Contrary to our predictions, our findings indicate that adding sustainability-oriented awareness and attitudinal nudges to Investor Profile Questionnaires did not result in participants decreasing the proportion of funds they invested in business-as-usual firms that focus primarily on maximizing financial returns. However, as predicted, the awareness and attitudinal nudges did increase the proportion of funds invested in firms that compromise financial returns in order to optimize social and ecological well-being. Moreover, investors\u2019 attitudes towards sustainable investing were more positive after they received an action nudge versus (merely) an awareness nudge.

This study utilized qualitative data collection methods to gather perspectives from both internal and external stakeholders to understand how the roles and responsibilities of internal stakeholders collectively help initiate brand advocacy campaigns. In this study, collaborative networks, partner selection, and research and development were assessed with respect to the co-development business model that leads to positive gendered well-being. It was found that there is an existing tension between the normative aspects of beauty and the internal perceptions of consumers. However, respondents shared that the advocacy campaigns facilitated by both influencers and ambassadors as part of the Dove Philippines projects launched in 2020 and 2021 were effective, since they enhanced their self-acceptance, self-esteem, and self-empowerment. The findings from the study can be used as a foundation for future research regarding influencer and ambassador marketing in the Philippines. In addition, it provides a practical application of the co-development business model not only to achieve mainstream business and marketing goals, but more importantly, advancing well-being.","keywords":["Influencers","brand ambassadors","co-development","social well-being","gendered well-being"]},{"title":"Resilience and Hospitality in a Pandemic: A Polar-Type Study on Hotels in the Discovery Hospitality Group in the Philippines","type":"Research Paper","issue2":true,"link":"journal-files/Hospitality-Belila.pdf","author":{"name":"Ysabel Y.

This study employs a polar-type multiple case study research design using qualitative data gathered through semi-structured, in-depth interviews with semi-closed questions. The data was analyzed to assess the viability of key indicators that compose organizational resilience. Proactive consideration of external conditions is imperative for a hotel to be resilient and to survive in a pandemic. The external conditions that were found to be important in this study are: (1) location of the hotel, (2) population in the geographical location, (3) access points, and (4) government regulations. The authors propose that organizational resilience in the pandemic context relies on the following insights: (1) the interdependence of adaptive capacity, planning, and proactive consideration of external conditions; (2) clarity and discipline in serving a concrete target market; and (3) partnerships across private and public sectors. The research findings and key outcomes are interpreted as theoretical insights in the context of the operating environment of the case.

Accordingly, this research builds on existing studies on these variables, exploring the mediating effect of innovative behaviour on workplace friendship and entrepreneurial intention. The investigation employed a quantitative, descriptive, causal, cross-sectional survey among 278 Philippine-based MSMEs. The results reveal that workplace friendships influence both innovative behaviour and entrepreneurial intention, and as shown in the model, innovative behaviour fully mediates workplace friendships and entrepreneurial intention.

All these advances unearth serious ethical concerns of human identity and cosmic sustainability that we address here. Further, the current understanding of sustainability development (SD) is highly anthropocentric (i.e., the earth is meant solely for man\u2019s use), and limited in scope as a terrestrial, temporal, economic and pro-human project. We expand SD to include trans-terrestrial, trans-temporal, trans-economic, and trans-human developments.  We view this complex problem by distinguishing anthropocentric (nature is for man) versus non-anthropocentric (man is for nature) modern views of natural sustainability; Each view can be made to include either natural outcomes / processes of nature, or industrial uses and outcomes of nature to provide a four-fold framework of Natural Sustainability within which we explore ethical implications of outer space advances (OSA). We discuss managerial implications and limitations and suggest directions for future research.","keywords":["Outer space industry","Terraforming celestial bodies","Natural Sustainability","Cosmic Sustainability","Transhumanism"]},{"title":"Determinants of Employee Volunteer Intention: An Empirical Study on Functional Motivation Theory","type":"Research Paper","link":"journal-files/Employee-Volunteerism.pdf","author":{"name":"Ericka Chua, Marika Chuateco, Leise Mangune, Jannine Shen, Patrick Adriel H.

The respondents were divided by gender, age group, and volunteer experience to see whether these factors would significantly affect motivation; only volunteer experience emerged as significant in the findings. Another interesting finding is that employees are more inspired to volunteer when they can learn something new, and furthermore that women are more motivated by the social motive than men and are thus more likely to volunteer when their friends do so.","keywords":["Corporate Social Responsibility","Volunteerism","Employee Motives","Volunteer Experience","Gender"]},{"title":"The power of Pause in enhancing ethical leadership","type":"Research Paper","link":"journal-files/PAUSE-INENHANCING.pdf","author":{"name":"Mary Kay Chess, Magda Capellao Kaspary, Stacey Heiligenthaler, Patty Neil, Megan Ratcliffe & Petural \u2018PJ\u2019 Shelton","name_raw":"Oswald A.J.

In his recent book review, Machines Like Me, Kim writes on the varied ethical systems potentially used in AI training as he discusses the character development of the text.  Whether a deontological approach or a consequentialist approach, AI is only as good as the training and the data provided.  In this interview he says that to really address ethics issues in AI, much more funding should be given to moral philosophy and applied ethics."]},{"title":"Christian U.

After all, the onus of CSR does not lie solely on the leadership, rather employees need to be equally invested in becoming part of the organizational culture.

Although the exhortation has been on the radar for three decades, pernicious business practices ensue.  To address the problem, sustainability champions seek innovations. One of these innovations is the circular economy. Dr. Nancy Bocken, Professor of Sustainable Business at the Maastricht Sustainability Institute (MSI), is a leading scholar in the field. She has embarked on a project on circular economy innovation and counsels professionals and legislators on the conversion of businesses to a circular service business model.  In this interview, Dr. Bocken explains the four key strategies of a circular economy, how these strategies link to the ethical aspect of doing business, and concomitantly how these strategies lead to profitability. On one hand, she provides examples of unsustainable business models. On the other hand, she explains the creation of sustainable value at the different stages of a business and at different levels in the organization.

Challenges such as collapsing business models, collapses in their perceived credibility and trustworthiness, and consistent attack from governments intolerant of criticism \u2013 or any level of scrutiny continue. Some of those governments are autocratic, but others are supposedly liberal democracies where news is traditionally regarded as an essential element in the democratic process.   Thus, now presents a timely moment to pose the question Tony Harcup presents us with: What\u2019s the point of News? At the heart of this inquiry is an interrogation of what we understand by \u201cnews\u201d. On the face of it, the answer is obvious \u2013 it is what we see and hear and read on TVs and radios, on our screens and on the pages of newspapers. But Harcup has spent many years teasing apart the processes that put that stuff together, shape it, structure it, define it \u2013 what is selected to be news, what is rejected \u2013 and why.
